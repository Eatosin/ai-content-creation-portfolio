# AI-Content-Creation-Portfolio

My AI-enhanced tutorial project for prompt engineering and content workflows. Built as part of my prep for AI Trainer roles—leveraging my physics background to create educational AI tools. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Eatosin/ai-content-creation-portfolio)

## What's Inside
- **[Tutorial DOCX](AI_Enhanced_Content_Creation_Tutorial_FINAL.docx)**: A 3-lesson mini-curriculum on using AI (LLMs like Grok) for SEO-optimized YouTube/blog scripts. Includes examples, metrics, and exercises.
- **[Generation Script](generate_tutorial.py)**: Python code that auto-builds the .docx file using `python-docx`. (Run it locally to recreate—shows powerful automation)
- **[Updated Resume PDF](Owadokun_Resume_Updated.pdf)**: My background in physics, AI prompt engineering, content creation, and customer-facing roles.

## Quick Demo
This project demonstrates:
- **STAR Method**: Situation (creator bottlenecks), Task (AI workflows), Action (tools like Canva/CapCut), Result (2x faster scripts, +20% engagement).
- Tech Stack: Python, LLMs, WordPress, video editing.

## About Me
Physics undergrad (University of Calabar) with final project in Atmospheric Physics. Passionate about blending quantum concepts with AI hacks. Open to collaborating on AI training/data annotation!
